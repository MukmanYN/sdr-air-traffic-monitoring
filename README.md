# SDR Air Traffic Communication Monitoring  

## üõ´ Project Overview  
This project implements a **Software-Defined Radio (SDR)** system to intercept and analyze live air traffic communications from the **Frederick Douglass Greater Rochester International Airport**. Using an **ADALM-PLUTO SDR** and a **simple dipole antenna**, the system demodulates **AM signals** from the **118-136 MHz aviation band** and processes them with **MATLAB** for signal analysis.  

The primary goal was to explore the capabilities of **SDRs for aviation communication** and understand the behavior of **AM signals** in real-world conditions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture and Setup  

### üì° **Hardware:**  
- **ADALM-PLUTO SDR:** Modified for extended frequency range (70 MHz to 6 GHz)  
- **Simple Dipole Antenna:** Tuned to 1.87 feet for the target frequency  
- **Power Supply:** Standard USB connection for Pluto SDR  

### üñ•Ô∏è **Software:**  
- **SDR#:** For signal demodulation and live frequency scanning  
- **PuTTY:** For terminal access to the SDR  
- **MATLAB:** For signal processing and audio enhancement  

### üõ†Ô∏è **SDR Modification:**  
- Overcame the Pluto SDR's frequency limitation (`325 MHz - 3800 MHz`) by modifying its firmware, expanding its range to **70 MHz - 6 GHz** with a **56 MHz bandwidth**.  
- Used an **older version of SDR#** for compatibility with the modified Pluto SDR.
